##What is Luka?
An IRC bot written in Perl, very original idea.

It features a modular "plugins" system allowing for infinite yet diverse functionality based on usage scenario backed by a supportive framework.

##Getting Started
Luka is programmed on and with [DWIM Perm](http://dwimperl.com/) in mind. Mileage may vary out-of-the-box with other flavors.

If perl is your path run the appropriate run-*.* file based on your operating system.
If perl is not in your path run **Luka.pl** manually however you can.
